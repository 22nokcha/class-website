    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Andrea Kim. I am currently a <span class="highlight">junior studying illustration</span>.
        I plan to pursue a career in <span class="highlight">concept art/visual development</span> for games or animated
        films.
        Although that is the ultimate goal, I am still unsure. Perhaps I will end up doing something else.
        No one knows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my hobbies include <span class="highlight">night runs/walks, reading, martial arts, light cooking/baking, small
        talk (sometimes), finding new bakeries/cafes, and trying new things</span>.
        I think it is so interesting how humans can manipulate their body, especially limbs, in different ways that can
        help them achieve different levels of power. I think having been a competitive taekwondo athlete for many years is what influenced my fasination by it
        and of just <span class="highlight">human anatomy and movement</span> in general. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of interests, I recently have been dying over <span class="highlight"><i>Peanuts</i></span> comic
        strips and the cartoon.
        But specifically for <span class="highlight">Snoopy and Woodstock</span>.
        Their close friendship is so cute and wholesome.
        I would say their friendship is the ideal of friendships.
