  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Andrea Kim, and I am currently a junior studying illustration. 
    I plan to pursue a career in concept art/visual development for games or animated films. 
    Although that is the ultimate goal, I am still unsure. Perhaps I will end up doing something else.
    No one knows.
  </p>

   Some of my hobbies include night runs/walks, light weightlifting, kicking, baking, small talk (sometimes), finding new bakeries/cafes, and trying new things.
   By "kicking," I just mean the action of it. 
   I used to be a competitive martial arts athlete for many years so I have this lingering passion and enjoyment for kicking.
   I think it is so interesting that humans can manipulate their body, especially limbs, in different ways that can help them achieve greater strength.
  </p>

    Speaking of interests, I recently got into Peanuts comics. 
    But specifically for Snoopy and Woodstock. 
    Their close friendship is so cute and wholesome. 
    I would say their friendship is the ideal of friendships.
