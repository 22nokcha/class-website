    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Andrea Kim. I am currently a junior studying illustration.
        I plan to pursue a career in concept art/visual development for games or animated films.
        Although that is the ultimate goal, I am still unsure. Perhaps I will end up doing something else.
        No one knows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my hobbies include night runs/walks, light weightlifting, kicking, baking, small talk (sometimes),
        finding
        new bakeries/cafes, and trying new things.
        By "kicking," I just mean the action of it.
        I used to be a competitive martial arts athlete for many years so I have this lingering passion and enjoyment
        for
        kicking.
        I think it is so interesting how humans can manipulate their body, especially limbs, in different ways that can
        help them achieve different levels of power.
      </p>

        Speaking of interests, I recently have been dying over <i>Peanuts</i> comic strips and the cartoon.
        But specifically for Snoopy and Woodstock.
        Their close friendship is so cute and wholesome.
        I would say their friendship is the ideal of friendships.
