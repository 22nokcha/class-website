    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Andrea Kim. I am currently a <span class="highlight">junior studying illustration</span>.
        I plan to pursue a career in <span class="highlight">concept art/visual development</span> for games or animated
        films.
        Although that is the ultimate goal, I am still unsure. Perhaps I will end up doing something else.
        No one knows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my hobbies include <span class="highlight">night runs/walks, light weightlifting, kicking, baking, small
          talk (sometimes),
          finding new bakeries/cafes, and trying new things</span>.
        By "kicking," I just mean the action of it.
        I used to be a competitive martial arts athlete for many years so I have this lingering passion and enjoyment
        for the action.
        I think it is so interesting how humans can manipulate their body, especially limbs, in different ways that can
        help them achieve different levels of power.
        This fascination probably derives from my interest in <span class="highlight">human anatomy and movement</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of interests, I recently have been dying over <span class="highlight"><i>Peanuts</i></span> comic
        strips and the cartoon.
        But specifically for <span class="highlight">Snoopy and Woodstock</span>.
        Their close friendship is so cute and wholesome.
        I would say their friendship is the ideal of friendships.
